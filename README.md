Known issues
------------

Vs. SMB breaks the normal framerule rng patterns from SMB1.

There's as far as I can tell effectively no way to map out framerule rng in the game.. So, you can still select rng in the practise rom, but note that it won't match up with the real game.

Usage
-----

The easiest way to apply this patch is to go to https://www.romhacking.net/patch/

Place the Super Mario Bros 1 rom in the "rom file", and the IPS from this archive into the "patch file" and press apply patch!

You can of course use Lunar IPS or FLIPS if you'd prefer.
